A discord bot for The Elder Scrolls Online

# Inviting the Bot to your guild

You don't have to install anything, you just have to invite it to your guild by clicking this link:

https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=251443671541481472&scope=bot

Give it read/write/embed permissions, then it should be fine. Nothing else required!

# Installation

Installation is tricky atm, since there are many factors that are not easily reproducible and need setup in MySQL and Discord. I will write down a simple guide in a bit and create a minimal working example bot, that does not require SQL and other preferences. 

A basic setup guide is to be found in ```installation.md``` but it is not complete yet.

If you want install it anyway, check our dev channel here: https://discord.gg/VNrzzvg
